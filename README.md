Usage
===

#### Requirements
For Ubuntu
* build-essential
* python
* Coin daemon(s) (find the coin's repo and build latest version from source)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v11.0+

```
sudo apt install redis-server build-essential python libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libsodium-dev -y
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | sudo -E bash
```
Ubuntu 18.04+
  * use NVM(https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for debian/ubuntu.
 ```
nvm install 11
source ~/.bashrc
```
* [Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store v2.6+ 
  * For Ubuntu: 
```
sudo apt-get install redis-server
sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
add supervised systemd
sudo systemctl enable redis.service
sudo systemctl start redis.service
 ```
 Dont forget to tune redis-server:
 ```
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo 1024 > /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn
 ```
 Add this lines to your /etc/rc.local and make it executable
 ```
 chmod +x /etc/rc.local
 ```
* For issues with Block unlocking: `npm install async@1.5.2 `

##### Seriously
Those are legitimate requirements. If you use old versions of Node.js or Redis that may come with your system package manager then you will have problems. Follow the linked instructions to get the last stable versions.

[**Redis warning**](http://redis.io/topics/security): It'sa good idea to learn about and understand software that
you are using - a good place to start with redis is [data persistence](http://redis.io/topics/persistence).

**Do not run the pool as root** : create a new user without ssh access to avoid security issues :
```bash
sudo adduser --disabled-password --disabled-login your-user
```
To login with this user : 
```
sudo su - your-user
```

#### 1) Downloading & Installing


Clone the repository and run `npm update` for all the dependencies to be installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lloir/cryptonote-nodejs-pool pool
cd pool

npm update
```
#### 3) Start the pool

```bash
node init.js
```

The file `config.json` is used by default but a file can be specified using the `-config=file` command argument, for example:

```bash
node init.js -config=config_backup.json
```

This software contains four distinct modules:
* `pool` - Which opens ports for miners to connect and processes shares
* `api` - Used by the website to display network, pool and miners' data
* `unlocker` - Processes block candidates and increases miners' balances when blocks are unlocked
* `payments` - Sends out payments to miners according to their balances stored in redis
* `chartsDataCollector` - Processes miners and workers hashrate stats and charts
* `telegramBot`	- Processes telegram bot commands


By default, running the `init.js` script will start up all four modules. You can optionally have the script start
only start a specific module by using the `-module=name` command argument, for example:

```bash
node init.js -module=api
```

[Example screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/SEgrI3b.png) of running the pool in single module mode with tmux.

To keep your pool up, on operating system with systemd, you can create add your pool software as a service.  
Use this [example](https://github.com/dvandal/cryptonote-nodejs-pool/blob/master/deployment/cryptonote-nodejs-pool.service) to create the systemd service `/lib/systemd/system/cryptonote-nodejs-pool.service`
Then enable and start the service with the following commands : 

```
sudo systemctl enable cryptonote-nodejs-pool.service
sudo systemctl start cryptonote-nodejs-pool.service
```

#### 4) Host the front-end

Simply host the contents of the `website_example` directory on file server capable of serving simple static files.


Edit the variables in the `website_example/config.js` file to use your pool's specific configuration.
Variable explanations:

```javascript

/* Must point to the API setup in your config.json file. */
var api = "http://poolhost:8117";

/* Pool server host to instruct your miners to point to (override daemon setting if set) */
var poolHost = "poolhost.com";

/* Number of coin decimals places (override daemon setting if set) */
"coinDecimalPlaces": 4,

/* Contact email address. */
var email = "support@poolhost.com";

/* Pool Telegram URL. */
var telegram = "https://t.me/YourPool";

/* Pool Discord URL */
var discord = "https://discordapp.com/invite/YourPool";

/*Pool Facebook URL */
var facebook = "https://www.facebook.com/<YourPoolFacebook";

/* Market stat display params from https://www.cryptonator.com/widget */
var marketCurrencies = ["{symbol}-BTC", "{symbol}-USD", "{symbol}-EUR", "{symbol}-CAD"];

/* Used for front-end block links. */
var blockchainExplorer = "http://chainradar.com/{symbol}/block/{id}";

/* Used by front-end transaction links. */
var transactionExplorer = "http://chainradar.com/{symbol}/transaction/{id}";

/* Any custom CSS theme for pool frontend */
var themeCss = "themes/light.css";

/* Default language */
var defaultLang = 'en';

```

#### 5) Customize your website

The following files are included so that you can customize your pool website without having to make significant changes
to `index.html` or other front-end files thus reducing the difficulty of merging updates with your own changes:
* `custom.css` for creating your own pool style
* `custom.js` for changing the functionality of your pool website


Then simply serve the files via nginx, Apache, Google Drive, or anything that can host static content.

#### SSL

You can configure the API to be accessible via SSL using various methods. Find an example for nginx below:

* Using SSL api in `config.json`:

By using this you will need to update your `api` variable in the `website_example/config.js`. For example:  
`var api = "https://poolhost:8119";`

* Inside your SSL Listener, add the following:

``` javascript
location ~ ^/api/(.*) {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8117/$1$is_args$args;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
```

By adding this you will need to update your `api` variable in the `website_example/config.js` to include the /api. For example:  
`var api = "http://poolhost/api";`

You no longer need to include the port in the variable because of the proxy connection.

* Using his own subdomain, for example `api.poolhost.com`:

```bash
server {
    server_name api.poolhost.com
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    
    ssl_certificate /your/ssl/certificate;
    ssl_certificate_key /your/ssl/certificate_key;

    location / {
        more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *';
        proxy_pass http://127.0.01:8117;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

By adding this you will need to update your `api` variable in the `website_example/config.js`. For example:  
`var api = "//api.poolhost.com";`

You no longer need to include the port in the variable because of the proxy connection.


#### Upgrading
When updating to the latest code its important to not only `git pull` the latest from this repo, but to also update
the Node.js modules, and any config files that may have been changed.
* Inside your pool directory (where the init.js script is) do `git pull` to get the latest code.
* Remove the dependencies by deleting the `node_modules` directory with `rm -r node_modules`.
* Run `npm update` to force updating/reinstalling of the dependencies.
* Compare your `config.json` to the latest example ones in this repo or the ones in the setup instructions where each config field is explained. You may need to modify or add any new changes.

### JSON-RPC Commands from CLI

Documentation for JSON-RPC commands can be found here:
* Daemon https://wiki.bytecoin.org/wiki/JSON_RPC_API
* Wallet https://wiki.bytecoin.org/wiki/Wallet_JSON_RPC_API


Curl can be used to use the JSON-RPC commands from command-line. Here is an example of calling `getblockheaderbyheight` for block 100:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:18081/json_rpc -d '{"method":"getblockheaderbyheight","params":{"height":100}}'
```


### Monitoring Your Pool

* To inspect and make changes to redis I suggest using [redis-commander](https://github.com/joeferner/redis-commander)
* To monitor server load for CPU, Network, IO, etc - I suggest using [Netdata](https://github.com/firehol/netdata)
* To keep your pool node script running in background, logging to file, and automatically restarting if it crashes - I suggest using [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) or [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)
